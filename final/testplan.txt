Test Plan
Test 1
We first test client's configure command. This is the foundational test since all other commands depend on the info stored in the
.configure file that this command generates as a result.
Test 2
Second, we test creating a project. This makes sure that the client can connect to the server and send a "packet" that tells the
server what command to execute.
