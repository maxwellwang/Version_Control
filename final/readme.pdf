# Version Control
Version Control is a program for allowing multiple clients to edit projects stored in a server.

## Description
Version Control is a program that consists of a server and clients. The server holds projects that the client can interact with by
changing the projects in a manner that always changes the most recent version. Once the client configures the hostname/ip address
and port number to connect to, all of the other commands can connect to the server to request and possibly modify resources. After
creating a project, clients can destroy it, add files to it, or remove files from it. Another way to get a project into a client is
through checkout. Pushing the code to the server is a 2-stage process, commit and then push. This is only possible if the client is
confirmed to have the latest version. The opposite of this is when clients pull from the server, which is also a 2-stage process,
update and then upgrade. Finally, the client can request the current version of the serverside project, the history of pushes to
said project, and roll back to an earlier version.

## Usage
Server
```
./WTFserver <port number>
(client connects, executes commands, disconnects)
^C (SIGINT)
```
Client
```
(once server has started running...)
./WTF configure <hostname or ip address> <port number>
./WTF create <project name>
./WTF destroy <project name>
./WTF checkout <project name>
./WTF add <project name> <file name>
./WTF remove <project name> <file name>
./WTF commit <project name>
./WTF push <project name>
./WTF update <project name>
./WTF upgrade <project name>
./WTF currentversion <project name>
./WTF history <project name>
./WTF rollback <project name> <version>
```

## Implementation
Each of the functions that interact with project contents contains a critical section where the mutex for said project is locked until
the function completes. Then inside the function, it connects to the client and receives whatever information is necessary for the
function within a packet structure that we define. If it encounters any errors, it can send error codes back to the client so that
the client knows what error prevented the operation from executing to completion. The server can send files back to the client in a
compressed form, into a directory we named _wtf_dir where it is decompressed.

## Thread Synchronization
The server begins by initializing an array of mutexes, one for each project directory found in its repository. Whenever create is
called, it also adds to the array of mutexes. Then, for each function that interacts with a project's contents, the mutex for said
project is locked and then unlocked after the function completes. This way, if another thread tries to call a function that interacts
with the same project that is already being interacted with by another thread, it is blocked from continuing. Since mutexes are
guaranteed to resolve in order, the next thread that asked for the mutex to edit the corresponding project will be the next one
to lock the mutex and execute a function involving it. This system guarantees that 2 threads never interact with a project at the
same time. Note: Destroy does not delete mutexes because all the functions first check if the project exists before locking a mutex,
so a deleted project's mutex will never be locked again.
