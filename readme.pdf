# Version Control

Version Control is a program for allowing multiple clients to edit projects stored in a server.

changing the projects in a manner that always changes the most recent version.

## Usage

make
cd serverDir
./WTFserver <port number>
(open separate window)
cd clientDir
./WTF configure <ip address/hostname> <port number>
./WTF create <project name>

^C
```
