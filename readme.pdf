# Version Control
Version Control is a program for allowing multiple clients to edit projects stored in a server.

## Description
Version Control is a program that consists of a server and clients. The server holds projects that the client can interact with by
changing the projects in a manner that always changes the most recent version. Once the client configures the hostname/ip address
and port number to connect to, all of the other commands can connect to the server to request and possibly modify resources. After
creating a project, clients can destroy it, add files to it, or remove files from it. Another way to get a project into a client is
through checkout. Pushing the code to the server is a 2-stage process, commit and then push. This is only possible if the client is
confirmed to have the latest version. The opposite of this is when clients pull from the server, which is also a 2-stage process,
update and then upgrade. Finally, the client can request the current version of the serverside project, the history of pushes to
said project, and roll back to an earlier version.

## Usage
Server
```
./WTFserver <port number>
(client connects, executes commands, disconnects)
^C (SIGINT)
```
Client
```
(once server has started running...)
./WTF configure <hostname or ip address> <port number>
./WTF create <project name>
./WTF destroy <project name>
./WTF checkout <project name>
./WTF add <project name> <file name>
./WTF remove <project name> <file name>
./WTF commit <project name>
./WTF push <project name>
./WTF update <project name>
./WTF upgrade <project name>
./WTF currentversion <project name>
./WTF history <project name>
./WTF rollback <project name> <version>
```
